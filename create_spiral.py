CREATED BY: HAMZA PATWA

This script creates one spiral of 13 tubulin dimers. It creates 13 new files in addition to the existing one, each for a new tubulin dimer.
Uses the "1jff.pdb" Protein DataBase (PDB) file.
Based on instructions in N. S. Babcock et. al. (2023) [Preprint] (arXiv:2302.01469) and G. L. Celardo et. al. (2019) (DOI: 10.1088/1367-2630/aaf839).

USAGE: $ python create_spiral.py num_spirals

num_spirals is an integer that specifies number of spirals to generate PDB files for. The number of PDB files that will be generated is 13 * num_spirals.

The read_pdb() method reads a PDB file.
-----------------------------
INPUT:  
	filename: Name of the PDB file as a string. 

OUTPUT: 
	(jffArr, jffAtoms): Tuple of length 2. The element at index 0 is an array that contains all the lines of the PDB file. The element at index 1 contains only those lines that start with the 'ATOM' keyword.

		jffArr = jff.readlines()
	
	jffAtoms = [line for line in jffArr if line[0:4] == "ATOM"]
	return (jffArr, jffAtoms)


'''
The transform_dimer() method applies specified translations and rotations to one dimer (one PDB file).
-----------------------------
INPUT:  
	jffAtoms: Element at index 1 of the output of read_pdb().
	rotation_deg: The rotation angle in degrees. 
	translation: The translation amount in Angstroms.
	
OUTPUT: 
	jffAtomPositions: Array whose length is the number of atoms in the PDB file. Every element of the array contains another array of length 3, containing new x, y, and z positions of an atom in the PDB file.

	# Uncomment the below line if you desire your table to match exactly with Nathan's table.
	# TODO: Maybe this line WOULD affect the physics, since it would lead to a microtubule with a different radius?
	#jffAtomPositions = jffAtomPositions + np.array([0.000, 0.959, -2.803])
	
	# Perform rotation and translation specified by input arguments

	jffAtomPositions = jffAtomPositions + np.array([translation, 0.000, 0.000])

	return jffAtomPositions
	

'''
The create_pdb() method creates a new PDB file from the new positions.
-----------------------------
INPUT:  
	originalArr: Element at index 0 of the output of read_pdb() (this is for all the other lines in the PDB file besides the ones starting with 'ATOM').
	originalArrAtoms: Element at index 1 of the output of read_pdb() (this is for the other characters in the lines starting with 'ATOM').
	newPositions: Output of transform_dimer(). These are substituted for the old positions.
	filename: Desired filename of the new PDB file that will be created.

OUTPUT: 
	NONE. A new PDB file is created, but this function doesn't return anything.
